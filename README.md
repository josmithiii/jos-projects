# jos-projects

This repo will cover a number of projects, but right now it is for me to learn codespaces et al.

## Main Repositories
- <a href="https://github.com/josmithiii/faust-jos"><b>faust-jos:</b></a> Faust software initiated and maintained by jos.

- <a href="https://github.com/josmithiii/josm_faust"><b>josm_faust:</b></a> C++ Modules for use with the JUCE Framework, based on jos functions from the Faust Libraries.

- <a href="https://github.com/josmithiii/l2hmj"><b>l2hmj:</b></a> Aborted attempt to make a fork of latex2html using MathJax as its simple-math mode, but it's the only distribution that can compile my books, so I have to keep it going.  (I tried to submit all my fixes but there was too much chaos and no central maintainer. Now it would be quite a merge hell to take on.)

- <a href="https://github.com/josmithiii/JOSModules"><b>JOSModules:</b></a>  C++ modules written in the JUCE Module Format and are intended to supplement the usual JUCE modules.  Only placeholders at this point.
